###Favorite Foods: 
* Fried rice
* Rice cake
* Vietnamese noodle dishes and soups (Yeah, we have many kinds of [noodle dishes and soups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Vietnamese_dishes) ) :yum:
* Onigiri :rice_ball:
* Kimbap (or gimbap)
* Chicken and Beef

My favorite foods are mostly Asian foods such as fried rice, rice cake, all kinds of Vietnamese noodle dishes and soups, onigiri, kimbap (or gimbap), and other Korean foods.

Why? Maybe because I’m Asian. I have grown up with my mom’s dishes, and love everything she cooks. :heart:

###Favorite Movie: 
There are so many movies that I like, but I will pick Harry Potter. </br>

The reason I like this movie is because I love fantasy genre. This movie combines all kind of action, magic, and adventure,… I just love it. :sparkles:

###Favorite Game:
I barely have time to play game now, but when I was in middle schools, I played GunBound, Command & Conquer: Yuri’s Revenge, Counter-strike, and some MMORPGs that I can’t remember the name. </br>

My favorite is GunBound. It allows me to constantly rethink of aiming angle and trajectory power setting based on the changes of wind currents, elemental phenomena, and terrain condition for each turn. It has different game modes, and many items, maps, and mobiles to choose from as well. The graphics are also cute. :laughing:
