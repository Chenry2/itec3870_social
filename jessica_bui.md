I enjoy Asian food...this is probably because I am Asian.

### Favorite Game:
I love playing MOBA video games!  My favorite video game is **League of Legends** because I enjoy taking my fustrations out on others in a healthy (legal) way.

###Favorite Movie:
1.  Big Hero 6
2.  Lion King
3.  Wall-E

It's kind of obvious that I love Disney movies.  They make me smile, the songs are oddly addicting, and the art/animation is to me breath-taking.
