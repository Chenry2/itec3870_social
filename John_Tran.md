#Favorite game
*The Witcher 3 - I've been playing this game since it's release and still haven't finish it. Blaming the story and combat system for making me addicted to it.
legacy of Kain: soul reaver - The gameplay isn't that good but it was the first game that got me into the story of the game.

#favorite food
*pizza - since you can put a lot of toppings on it.
