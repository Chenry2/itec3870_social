# Favorite Food
- Seafood
-- Because it tastes clean and light and can make a lot of combinations using it, and coconut is awesome :yum: :fish: :sushi: :smile:. It also doesn't make you feel full and fat and stuffed and doesn't put me to sleep like chicken or red meat.

# Favorite Game
- I'm not much of a gamer (yea so sue me!:fu: :tongue:) but I do sometimes (rarely) play Pokemon Yellow and Emerald on an emulator. I played that a lot when I was much younger and I loved it a lot.
