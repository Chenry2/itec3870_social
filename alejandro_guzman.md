# Favorite Food

Because it tastes clean and light and you can make a lot of combinations with it, and coconut is awesome. :yum: :fish: :sushi: :smile: It also doesn't make you feel fat and stuffed and doesn't put me to sleep :sleeping: like chicken or red meat. :sleepy:

# Favorite Movie and Book
:books: :books:
- Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by LaBerge and Rheingold
- Zen Flesh Zen Bones
- The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Larsson
- HTML & CSS design and build websites by Duckett, I'm including this one because the books design and layout is sooo nice

As far as movies, I love watching them and really looking at all what the director and actors put into it, but I really couldn't name a favorite. However, I love anything that is scary as shit and makes you not wanna fall asleep, like witchcraft, exorcism, ghosts, paranormal, all that stuff. :smiling_imp:

# Favorite Game
- I'm not much of a gamer (yea so sue me! :fu: :stuck_out_tongue:) but I do sometimes (rarely) play Pokemon Yellow and Emerald on an emulator. I played that a lot when I was much younger and I loved it. The music on Yellow takes me back :smile:
