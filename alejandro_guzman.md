# Favorite Food
- Seafood
-- Because it tastes clean and light and can make a lot of combinations using it, and coconut is awesome :coconut: :fish: :shrimp: :smile: ::. It also doesn't make you feel full and fat and stuffed and doesn't put me to sleep like chicken or red meat.
  - Jumbp Coconut Shrimp
  - Miso Salmon
  - Calamari
Also
- Delicious burgers from Burger 21
- And really anything with spicy sauce, like chicken wings 

# Favorite Movie and Book

# Favorite Game
- I'm not much of a gamer (yea so sue me!:tongue:) but I do sometimes (rarely) play Pokemon Yellow and Emerald on an emulator. I played that a lot when I was much younger and I loved it a lot.
