#Favorite Movie:
Maleficent - It is a well written re-write of what we think we
know about Snow White. I love that they just about threw away the
good guys versus bad guys theme and made a more practical portrayal
of good and bad by blurring the line. :smiling_imp:

#Favorite Game:
Bioshock Infinite - I love games with well written stories and Bioshock
made a great attempt to get the player emotionally invested in the story
and in protecting Elizabeth. :clap:

#Favorite Food:
Oven-baked Broccoli pasta - I like pasta and this is a dish that is
easy to make very filling and more vegetables can be added.
