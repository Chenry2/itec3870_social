> Man, I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I 
 see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation
  pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing 
 cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the 
 middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great
 Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. 
 We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires,
 and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. 
 And we're very, very pissed off.
