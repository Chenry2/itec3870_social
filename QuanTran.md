###Favorite Food

#Favorite Movie
I've watched lots of anime.  
Series I like are: Code Geass  :star: , CLANNAD :sob: , AIR :sob: , KANON :joy: , ...
These series really wonderful, I can re-watch them many times without getting bored.


#Favorite Game
I can play Chess quiet well. :eyes:
I also have an 3DS with games Pokemon, Fire Emblem, Bravely Defaults,...  I love them because they have touching story (Er... perhaps we should exclude Pokemon from this), and their graphics are nice too. Also, their theme songs are really great.
