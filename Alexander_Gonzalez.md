#Favorite Foods
I have **two** categories for favorite foods
* Foods with meat.
  * I like meat, and I think all meat is tasty. 
* Foods that taste good.
  * I will try any food that contains meat, but for me to like it, it must taste good.
  * Food that tastes good is food that doesn't taste bad :grin:

#Favorite Movie

**Thor 2: The Dark World** :godmode:

This is my favorite movie because it is filled with action and comedy. The action sequences include fast paced motions, quick camera movements and cuts, along with great wsound effects. The comedy side is defined by very subtle comments and actions, such as the movements of Mj√∂lnir :hammer: during the time that Thor is transported among the different worlds.

#Favorite Game

**Minecraft** :scream:

Minecraft is just an epic game. In creative mode :construction:, you have the freedom to desing amazing objects and places. I love being able to create my own living space. :hotel:
