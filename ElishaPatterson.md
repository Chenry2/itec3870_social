#Food
My favorite meals are:
* Italian pasta stuffed with cheese
* Crispy fried chicken with buffalo sauce.

It's hard to describe why I like them, but they certainly make my mouth water.

#Game
My favorite game is Scattergories. It's a great game to play with other people, particularly people
you're just getting to know as it an interesting way to see what creative ideas they can come up
with when put under the pressure of the time limit!
