###Favorite Food
*Thai Curry
*Pho Noodles 
*Ramen Noodles(The legit kind, not the stuff out of the pack)
*Hot and Spicy stir fry 
*Seafood and Chicken(Not big on red meat)
*Lots of fruit and vegetables, particularly strawberries and carrots


I love asian food since the day I was born. I am really into nutrition and eat lean white meat with lots of fruit and vegetables, not a lot of carbs. I have a hate relationship with butter, cheese, and sour cream. I used to weigh almost 300 pounds so that is why I choose the food lifestyle I live by today. I will never give up asian food though, whether its Thai, Hmong, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, does not matter. Not big on fried or greasy food either. 

#Favorite Movie
My favorite movies are the Lord of the Rings Series(including The Hobbit) and Harry Potter. I am a big fan of fantasy lore due to the imagination of the genre. I love magic and my favorite actor is Ian McKellan for playing Gandalf, the most epic wizard of all time. 

#Favorite Game
My favorite game would have to be Dragon Age Inquisition. I love the choices the player gets to make with the epic large scale battles against darkspawn, mages, templars, and all sorts of dragons. The party members are really well done in character and the crafting and customization of your army is really nice. Also, the combat is well put together making me feel like a total badass when I defeat a horde of red lyrium templars with my chain lightning. Really wish they added more dwarven cities and characters though. 


#Other random cool stuff about me
*I have a twin brother(my other half), and no twin telepathy is not real.

*Favorite Quote by Benjamin Franklin "Beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy"
*I completed my First Dan's Taekwondo Certification under the Kukkiwon(1st degree black belt)
*I do own a Gandalf tobacco pipe but I only smoke on very special occassions due to health risks. 
*I love to drink high gravity stouts and IPA's out of fancy stein mugs.
